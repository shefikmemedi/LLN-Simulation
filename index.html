    <h2>What Youâ€™re Seeing</h2>
    <p>
      Each line represents one simulated sequence of outcomes where an event with probability p occurs repeatedly.
      As the number of trials increases, the average frequency of successes (blue lines) begins to cluster around
      the true probability (gold line). This illustrates the <b>Law of Large Numbers</b>, which tells us that with
      enough observations, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical one.
