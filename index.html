    <p class="question">
      V. Simulate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) by plotting multiple (m) trajectories of (n) trials for the relative frequency f(n).
      Show with a histogram (possibly, a vertically oriented histogram placed on the right side of the main chart)
      how, as soon as n becomes large, the empirical distribution of f(n) (over all m trajectories)
      tends to the underlying probability p of success used in each trial.

      <h3>Simple Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        Each line represents one simulated sequence of outcomes where an event with probability <i>p</i> occurs repeatedly.
        As the number of trials increases, the average frequency of successes (blue lines)
        begins to cluster around the true probability (gold line).
        This demonstrates the <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong>,
        which shows that with enough observations, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical one.
