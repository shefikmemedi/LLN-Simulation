    <h3 class="question">
      V. Simulate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) by plotting multiple (m) trajectories of (n) trials for the relative frequency f(n). 
      Show with a histogram (possibly, a vertically oriented histogram placed on the right side of the main chart) how, as soon as n becomes large, 
      the empirical distribution of f(n) (over all m trajectories) tends to the underlying probability p of success used in each trial.

  <h1>Exploring the Law of Large Numbers in Action</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Watch how the relative frequency stabilizes near the true probability as the number of trials grows.

    <h2>What You’re Seeing</h2>
    <p>
      Each line represents one simulated sequence of outcomes where an event with probability <b>p</b> occurs repeatedly. 
      As the number of trials increases, the average frequency of successes (blue lines) begins to cluster around the true probability (gold line). 
      This illustrates the <b>Law of Large Numbers</b>, which tells us that with enough observations, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical one.
