    <p>
      Each line represents one simulated sequence of outcomes where an event with probability <em>p</em> occurs
      repeatedly. As the number of trials increases, the average frequency of successes (blue lines) begins to
      cluster around the true probability (gold line). This illustrates the <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong>,
      which tells us that with enough observations, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical one.
